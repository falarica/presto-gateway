# Presto Gateway
Presto Gateway is a Policy based query router for **PrestoDB/PrestoSQL** cluster. 
It sits in front of multiple or single presto clusters and becomes the interface for users. 
It can be used as a Load Balancer, to achieve high availability as well as a proxy. Its support for secure Presto clusters as well
as user authentication and transactions makes it fit for Production environment. 

Presto Gateway is based on Presto Proxy and hence sits inside a prestosql repo.
It uses multiple projects of Presto for things like security,
 transaction support etc. However, it is not tied with any specific
  version of Presto. In fact, it supports both PrestoDB and PrestoSQL.
  
In future, projects that are not needed will be removed from this repo.  

There are several advantages of using Presto Gateway:
- It provides a single UI interface for all the queries executed across the clusters.
- Ensuring High Availability in case of planned as well as accidental downtime.
- Load balance your clusters using rules which balances the load across the cluster.
- Having Rule based approach can also help in giving priority to a particular cluster.

## Requirements

* Mac OS X or Linux
* Java 11, 64-bit
* Python 2.6+ (for running with the launcher script)

## Building Presto Gateway

Presto is a standard Maven project. Simply run the following command from the project root directory:

    ./mvnw clean install

On the first build, Maven will download all the dependencies from the internet and cache them in the local repository (`~/.m2/repository`), which can take a considerable amount of time. Subsequent builds will be faster.

Presto has a comprehensive set of unit tests that can take several minutes to run. You can disable the tests when building:

    ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests

### Building the Web UI
To build the UI for gateway, following steps need to carried out before the code is built. 

Prerequisites:  Node package manager(npm) should be pre-installed. 

- Install dependencies needed for gateway UI
```
$ npm install presto-gateway-main/src/main/ngapp/
```
- Build gateway UI
```
$ npm run-script build --prefix=presto-gateway-main/src/main/ngapp/ 
``` 

## Running PrestoGateway in your IDE

### Overview

After building Presto Gateway for the first time, you can load the project into your IDE and run the server. We recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Because Presto is a standard Maven project, you can import it into your IDE using the root `pom.xml` file. In IntelliJ, choose Open Project from the Quick Start box or choose Open from the File menu and select the root `pom.xml` file.

After opening the project in IntelliJ, double check that the Java SDK is properly configured for the project:

* Open the File menu and select Project Structure
* In the SDKs section, ensure that JDK 11 is selected (create one if none exist)
* In the Project section, ensure the Project language level is set to 8 (Presto does not yet use Java 11 language features)

Presto comes with sample configuration that should work out-of-the-box for development. Use the following options to create a run configuration:

* Main Class: `io.prestosql.gateway.PrestoGateway`
* VM Options: `-ea -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M -XX:+UseGCOverheadLimit -XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent -Xmx2G -Dconfig=etc/config.properties -Dlog.levels-file=etc/log.properties -Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true`
* Working directory: `$MODULE_DIR$`
* Use classpath of module: `presto-gateway-main`


The working directory should be the `presto-gateway-main` subdirectory. In IntelliJ, using `$MODULE_DIR$` accomplishes this automatically.
   
The sample config.properties file is as follows:

    node.environment=test
    node.internal-address=localhost
    http-server.http.enabled=true
    http-server.http.port=8089
    gateway.shared-secret-file=etc/secret.txt
    gateway.clusterstats-pull-interval=10s
    gateway.ui-max-queryInfo-list-size=100
    datastore.hikariCPPropsFile=etc/hikaricp.properties

Additionally, the meta store must be configured with the location of your PostgreSQL instance. The configuration
for meta store can be provided in the file **hikaricp.properties**:
    
    minimumIdle=5
    connectionTestQuery=SELECT 1
    autoCommit=true
    maximumPoolSize=10
    jdbcUrl=jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/prestogateway
    username=prestogateway
    password=root123
    driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver

### Authentication
To make Presto Gateway useful for Production scenarios, support for Authentication is added.
There are differente types of Authentication enabled similar to Presto.

**Password File Authentication**
 
Presto can be configured to enable frontend password authentication over HTTPS for 
clients, such as the CLI, or the JDBC and ODBC drivers. The username
and password are validated against usernames and passwords stored in a file.

**Password File Authentication Configuration**

Enable password file authentication by creating an etc/password-authenticator.properties
 file in the etc directory:

    password-authenticator.name=file
    file.password-file=/path/to/password.db

You can provide following additional properties as well:

    file.refresh-period : How often to reload the password file. Defaults to 1m.
    file.auth-token-cache.max-size: Max number of cached authenticated passwords. Defaults to 1000.
    
For other Authentication configuration like kerberos, ldap please visit Presto's [security docs](https://prestosql.io/docs/current/security.html)

## Development

### Presto Gateway Module
The code for PrestoGateway module is in **presto-gateway-main** module.
The major components of the module are 
- RoutingManager
- MultiClusterManager
- GatewayResource
- ClusterMonitor
- ClusterStatsObserver
- ClusterMonitor
- QueryExecutionMonitor


### Code Style

We recommend you use IntelliJ as your IDE.
 The code style template for the project can be found in
  the [codestyle](https://github.com/airlift/codestyle) repository along with our
   general programming and Java guidelines. In addition to those you should also
    adhere to the following:

* Alphabetize sections in the documentation source files (both in the table of contents files and other regular documentation files). In general, alphabetize methods/variables/sections if such ordering already exists in the surrounding code.
* When appropriate, use the stream API. However, note that the stream implementation does not perform well so avoid using it in inner loops or otherwise performance sensitive sections.
* Categorize errors when throwing exceptions. For example, PrestoException takes an error code as an argument, `PrestoException(HIVE_TOO_MANY_OPEN_PARTITIONS)`. This categorization lets you generate reports so you can monitor the frequency of various failures.
* Ensure that all files have the appropriate license header; you can generate the license by running `mvn license:format`.
* Consider using String formatting (printf style formatting using the Java `Formatter` class): `format("Session property %s is invalid: %s", name, value)` (note that `format()` should always be statically imported). Sometimes, if you only need to append something, consider using the `+` operator.
* Avoid using the ternary operator except for trivial expressions.
* Use an assertion from Airlift's `Assertions` class if there is one that covers your case rather than writing the assertion by hand. Over time we may move over to more fluent assertions like AssertJ.
* When writing a Git commit message, follow these [guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### Additional IDE configuration

When using IntelliJ to develop Presto, we recommend starting with all of the default inspections,
with some modifications.

Enable the following inspections:

- ``Java | Internationalization | Implicit usage of platform's default charset``,
- ``Java | Class structure | Utility class is not 'final'``,
- ``Java | Class structure | Utility class with 'public' constructor``,
- ``Java | Class structure | Utility class without 'private' constructor``.

Disable the following inspections:

- ``Java | Performance | Call to 'Arrays.asList()' with too few arguments``,
- ``Java | Abstraction issues | 'Optional' used as field or parameter type``.

### Caveats
- HTTPS presto clusters require that Presto Gateway be HTTPS enabled and vice versa
- Supporting authorization in Gateway is work in progress.
- Same authenticator should be used for the gateway and presto servers. 
- All presto clusters need to have same catalogs for the queries to work transparently across clusters
